// TODO: create-react-app lockdown on module folder, and we want to refactor
//       (part of) this action out to be used by server. We could build a new
//       package for the refactored part. The new package can be npm-link,
//       npm-install-file, etc. Need to find a good dev story here.

// * 80% of actions, creation is only one side (main or renderer). Only the action name are shared.
// * 20% of actions maybe created by both side. Out of these actions:
//   * 80% of actions, their logic is different
//     * (?) Consider prompt: we call Electron for a native dialog. And in web app mode, we show the dialog in browser
//     * Think about a capability detection method (and overriding for dev story)
//   * 20% of actions, their logic is the same
