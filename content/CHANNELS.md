# Getting started with the Bot Inspector

[jump to Bot State Inspection](#bot-state-inspection)

## Prerequisites 
- A bot deployed to Azure configured to use the Teams channel.
- [The latest Emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

## TL;DR
1. Update your Emulator to be on version `4.4`. You can do this by selecting `Help` -> `Check for Update...`
1. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and navigate to the ngrok executable's location in a terminal.
2. Run ngrok `./ngrok http 3979 --host-header=localhost`
3. Open your bot in the [Azure Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/), select the `Settings` blade and paste the ngrok url provided in the terminal into the *Messaging Endpoint* field then save. **note:** If necessary, don't forget to add the `/api/messages` endpoint.
4. Set the appropriate environment variables (prefix with EXPORT for OSX/Linux, SET for Windows):
```bash
NODE_ENV=development;
MicrosoftAppId=<your app id>;
MicrosoftAppPassword=<your bot's password>;
```
5. Run your bot: `npm start`
6. Open the respective channel's chat link provided in the Azure Portal in the Channels blade.
7. Open the Emulator and toggle to Bot Inspector mode via `View` -> `Bot Inspector Mode`
8. Connect to your locally running Bot by pasting the URL to the Bot's endpoint in the connection modal. **note**: if configured with an external channel you may need to supply your Microsoft App Id & Microsoft App password.
9. Copy the `/INSPECT connect <UUID>` command rendered in the Conversation window and paste it into your configured channel's chat.

# Run Your Bot in an external Channel and observing with the Bot Framework Emulator
If you have configured your bot to [run in 1 or more channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-manage-channels?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and would like to test a locally running bot using the Emulator while interacting with it in a communication app (Teams, Skype, Slack, WebChat, etc.), these instructions will show you how.

**Note:** Since chat messages, Adaptive Cards, and other features have notable differences across the many available channels, the Emulator cannot visually recreate all experiences at this time. Instead, the Emulator provides the inspection of [channel-specific](https://blog.botframework.com/2017/03/28/Custom-Channel-Data/) protocol data and [internal bot state](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-state?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) as each turn context executes throughout the conversation within a channel.

# How it works
The tunneling software [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is used to create a tunnel to your locally running bot. The tunnel's URL is provided to your Web App bot in Azure. You build your bot with the BotBuilder **4.4** [InspectionMiddleware](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/1c790f4a4f0d761c215eb3841ff370f4b274f5d1/libraries/testbot/index.js#L21), and run it locally, chatting with it in Teams or another configured channel. The Emulator will receive the conversation's message exchange as usual, and some internal bot state information now being exposed through this middleware.

# Let's get Started
If you haven't already, get the [latest Emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases), [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and update your bot's dependencies to use BotBuilder v4.4+

## 1. Update Your Bot's Code
Your bot will need to configure the Bot Inspector middleware in order to connect to and send the conversation exchange to the Emulator. Include the [InspectionMiddleware](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/1c790f4a4f0d761c215eb3841ff370f4b274f5d1/libraries/testbot/index.js#L21) in your Bot's middleware stack:

```javascript
const { InspectionMiddleware } = require('botbuilder')
const { MicrosoftAppCredentials } = require('boframework-connector')

let credentials = undefined;
if (process.env.MicrosoftAppId && process.env.MicrosoftAppPassword) {
  credentials = new MicrosoftAppCredentials(process.env.MicrosoftAppId, process.env.MicrosoftAppPassword);
}

adapter.use(new InspectionMiddleware(inspectionState, userState, conversationState, credentials))
```

## 2. Run ngrok 
Open a terminal and run ngrok with the following command to create a new tunnel:

OSX
```bash
./ngrok http 3979 --host-header=localhost
```
Windows
```bash
"ngrok.exe" http 3979 --host-header=localhost
```

The output in the terminal should look something like this:

## 3. Update Azure to Point to the Tunnel
In the azure portal, [navigate to your bot's settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-manage-settings?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and paste the url provided by the ngrok terminal in the *Messaging endpoint* field and save the changes. Do not forget to use `/api/messages`. It's best to create a Bot in Azure that is used specifically for this purpose. Do not overwrite the messaging endpoint of a deployed production bot.

## 4. Set the appropiate environment variables in your Bot's running process & start the Bot
```bash
MicrosoftAppId=<your app id>;
MicrosoftAppPassword=<your bot's password>;
```
Node
```bash
node index.js
```
C#
```bash
dotnet run
```

## 4. Connect to a Channel & start a converstion in it
If you haven't already done so, [connect your bot to a channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-manage-channels?view=azure-bot-service-4.0). You may also need to download and install the app associated with the channel if you have't already. Afterwards, open the respective chat link provided in the Azure Portal in the Channels blade.

## 5. Start up the Emulator
Open the Emulator if it isn't open already. In the Emulator choose file > Bot Inspector Mode.

## 6. Connect to your locally running Bot Open Bot -> Url

## 7.  Copy the `/INSPECT connect <UUID>` command rendered in the Conversation window and paste it into the configured channel's chat

You can do this few ways. The easiest is by right-clicking on the rendered message and selecting "Copy text" from the context menu.

## 8. Have conversation in external channel

Have a normal conversation with your Bot in your configured channel, and while doing do you will see information populating in your connected conversation in the Emulator.

# Bot State Inspection

The Bot Inspector now renders the Bot State for each Turn Context executed in the Bot's runtime. You can view this by selecting the `Bot State` element rendered in the Conversation control in JSON or Graph form.

You can view the difference between Bot State's by right-clicking on one of these Bot State elements and selecting the "view diff with previous" item.
